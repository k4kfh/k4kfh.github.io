This is my personal site, powered by my fork of CMS.js. I have written a custom theme that supports responsive images, responsive embeds, syntax highlighting, and more, all via client-side JavaScript. This means I can blog from anywhere I have GitHub access, and all in simple Markdown syntax!

I blog about all sorts of things, so be sure to check it out!
